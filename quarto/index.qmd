`OpenScripturesHebrew.jl` is a Julia package for working with the morphological data of the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible](https://hb.openscriptures.org) project (OSHB). 

`OpenScripturesHebrew.jl` parses the OSHB data into easily manipulated Julia tuples, and provides a Julia data model for the OSHB morphological data.


## Quickest start

Get OSH annotations on all words in the Hebrew Bible:
```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using OpenScripturesHebrew
words = tanakh()
```

That's a lot of words!

```{julia}
length(words)
```

They're a bunch of tuples
```{julia}
versewords = oshverse("Gen", "1.1", words)
```

pull out the form and the morphology


```{julia}
map(versewords) do w
    string(w.mtoken, " = ", parseword(w))
end
```
