OSHB publishes word-level morphological annotations of the entire Hebrew Bible in [this github repository](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb).

- the annotations are formatted in XML validating against the [OSIS schema](http://crosswire.org/osis/)
- the values for OSHB's morphological codes are documented on [this web page](https://hb.openscriptures.org/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html)
