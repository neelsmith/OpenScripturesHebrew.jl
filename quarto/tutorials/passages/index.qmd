OSHB's annotated words are ordered in the sequence in which they occur in the Hebrew Bible, and include a reference to a specific verse represented with a CTS URN. Here is the URN for the first word (in the first verse) in the Hebrew Bible.


```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using OpenScripturesHebrew
words = tanakh()
```

```{julia}
words[1].urn
```

From a list of OSHB word annotations, you can select the words for a single verse using the OSHB abbreviation for a book and the canonical `chapter.verse` reference (separated by a period).


```{julia}
versewords = oshverse("Gen", "1.1", words)
```

Notice that all the selected words share the same URN value: `urn:cts:compnov:bible.genesis.osh:1.1`.
