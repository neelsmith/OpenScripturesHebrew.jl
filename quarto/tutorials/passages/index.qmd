## Find words by reference

Each tuple includes a `urn` property with the full string value of a CTS URN that looks like this `urn:cts:compnov:bible.genesis.osh:1.1` for *Genesis* 1.1. Use normal Julia filtering to find all words in *Genesis* 1.1:

```{julia}
using OpenScripturesHebrew
genesiswords = singlebook("Gen")
filter(wd -> wd.urn == "urn:cts:compnov:bible.genesis.osh:1.1", genesiswords)
```


Or use substring matching to find words by passage reference:


```{julia}
filter(wd -> endswith(wd.urn,":1.1"), genesiswords)
```

(Note that this could be messy if you have multiple books!)


```{julia}
torahwords = torah()
filter(wd -> endswith(wd.urn,":1.1"), torahwords)
```
