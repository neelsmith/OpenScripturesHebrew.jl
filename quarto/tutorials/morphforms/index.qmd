title: Morphological data
engine: julia

The `OpenScripturesHebrew.jl` package includes a rich model for the morphological data encoded in the OSHB data as string codes.  The morphological code is included as the `code` property in the named tuple that `OpenScripturesHebrew.jl`'s functions create when reading OSHB data.

```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using OpenScripturesHebrew
words = tanakh()
words[1].code
```

You can convert the tuple's code value to a Julia object with the `parseword` function.

```{julia}
morph1 = parseword(words[1])
```

These Julia objects are subtypes of the abstract `OSHMorphologicalForm`.

```{julia}
morph1 |> typeof 
```

```{julia}
morph1 |> typeof  |> supertype
```
